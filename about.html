                                Chi Ryu Jiujitsu is the inspiration of its Grand Master, Isham A. Latimer, and the
                                result
                                of
                                over a decade of development with his students, Master John Costanzo and Master John

                                creativity that each had developed from their training in the fine and performing arts
                                they,
                                ultimately, determined that any skill or technique is, simply, movement. Technique is
                                influenced by the formal study of a particular system over time and regardless of the
                                style,
                                every skill or technique has one fundamental element at its genesis: movement.

                                With those tenets in mind, Chi Ryu Jiujitsu's developers incorporated the training of
                                the
                                internal system, Hsing-I Liu Ho Ba Fa Chuan and it's concept of unbroken movement
                                coordinated
                                with breathing for all skills development. These skills include but are not limited to
                                -
                                teaching their students Proper breathing techniques.

                                Specially devised defensive techniques against empty hands and modern day weapons and
                                Forms
                                developed, specifically, for Chi Ryu Jiujitsu. The term 'forms' is preferred to 'kata'
                                because
                                it connotes the greater possibilities and applications within any movement rather than
                                techniques that have clearly defined and, therefore, limited parameters including
                                stopping and
                                starting.

                                Most importantly, the development of Chi Ryu Jiujitsu began and continues to evolve in
                                response
                                to the infinite manner in which physical skills may be influenced by challenges to the
                                human
                                physique (e.g. maintaining good health and doable at any age); judicial restrictions
                                regarding
                                the use of force; societal attitudes towards use of force and the practitioner's
                                purpose for
                                training.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, none of the aforementioned are more important than the physical survival of
                                the
                                practitioner. Therefore, it is considered that the training must be essentially geared
                                towards
                                this basic need given the, unfortunately, aggressive nature of our society.
